                <h3>Tennessee v. Garner</h3>
                <p>A police officer may use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect only if the officer has a good-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.</p>

            <div class="case-law">

                <p>An officer with reasonable suspicion and the good faith believe that the suspect is armed and dangerous, may conduct a 'stop and frisk' on a suspect without probable cause to arrest. The 'Terry Frisk' is a frisk of a person for any weapons that they have on their person.</p>

                <h3>Carroll v. United States</h3>
                <p>The "automobile exception" to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement allows warrantless searches of vehicles based on probable cause, due to their mobility. If an officer has made the determination that a crime has been, will be, or is being committed based on evidence, facts or circumstances, they can search a vehicle without the need of a search & seizure warrant solely for the piece of evidence related to the crime.</p>
                <p>Motorhomes can be searched without the need of a warrant if the officers have PC that there is evidence of a crime in said motorhome. (The exception to this are motorhomes with the lack of wheels that are supported by bricks and/or pillars.)</p>

            </div>

            <div class="case-law">
                <h3>United States v. Ross</h3>
                <p>The court ruled that police officers with probable cause to believe a vehicle contains contraband may conduct a warrantless search of the vehicle, including closed containers, as thorough as a magistrate could authorize with a warrant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-law">
                <h3>California v. Carney</h3>

            </div>

                <h3>United States v. Ludwig</h3>
                <p>A narcotics dog alert to a defendant's car provided probable cause for a warrantless search of the car's trunk, emphasizing the reliability of dog alerts in establishing probable cause.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-law">
                <h3>Scott v. Harris</h3>
                <p>A police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase, even if it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death, does not violate the Fourth Amendment if the officer's actions are objectively reasonable.</p>

            <div class="case-law">
                <h3>Garrity v. New Jersey - "Garrity Warning"</h3>
                <p>Public employees retain their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to give statements that could incriminate them. Statements compelled under a threat of job loss are inadmissible in a criminal trial. Public employees can still be compelled to make statements for internal, administrative purposes, and these compelled statements can be used for disciplinary actions, including termination.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-law">
                <h3>Graham v. Connor</h3>
                <p>Claims of excessive force by law enforcement during arrests, investigatory stops, or other seizures should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's "objective reasonableness" standard, not a due process standard.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-law">
                <h3>Mapp v. Ohio</h3>

                <h3>Davis v. United States</h3>

            </div>

            <div class="case-law">
                <h3>Maryland v. King</h3>
                <p>The United States Supreme Court decided that a cheek swab of an arrestee's DNA is comparable to fingerprinting and therefore, a legal police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment only when charging the arrestee with a violent crime. The individual must have committed a felony.</p>

                These case laws form the foundation of modern law enforcement procedures. Understanding them is crucial for making sound decisions in the field.
